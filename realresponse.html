			There wasn't enough space on the lahacks page for my proper reqsponse to
			this question, so here it is. It's a tad bit much more creepy than the
			other one, but it's also a lot more true to myself.

			I'd probably be the joker playing guitar then talking dreamily for hours.
			It's honestly difficult to choose a story for this, in part because I want
			to come across well, but I also want to be as honest as possible; I've
			been thinking for about 30 minutes, and this is the one I'll go with.

			<br />
			<br />
			I woke up from a nightmare, falling off what I thought was my bed, but
			landing right next to my computer, a couple feet away. Getting up, I
			realized it wasn't my bed I fell from- it was a chair. The glow of the
			monitor alerted me to the fact that, unbeknownst to me I'd been using it.
			I started recalling my dream: I remembered a girl, brunette, walking
			through a mountainy terrain painted as the work of an autumn impressionist
			in a sundress, with steps so light she might as well have been dancing. A
			herd of dogs, a stable with horses, a small bed, and two men in suits
			telling me that it was time, spraying my face with water as life had
			escaped my soul wit ha dying breath. Tears collected themselves gracefully
			in my eyes; I got up, and started reading what I had written in my sleep.
			I've never so much as sleepwalked in my life- this was new. Here's what I
			wrote:
			<br />
			<br />

			I was walking. I was walking down a crowded street, and through the
			oblivious smoky vacuum we call the air of Sarajevo, I saw a woman. I was
			taken. I couldn't speak. She walked up to me, rambling on. And I just
			watched. I just watched as her lips moved, in sync with what I'm sure was
			meant to be some kind of meaningful vibration, but I was deaf. I wasn't
			there. The woman, she led me to the sacred store, and in the store a
			thousand little gnomes, identical, equidistant, yet interesting, harrowing
			foreshadows of what was to come, and what was to never have come again. To
			the store I went, recounting what I last had known, screaming out in the
			embrace of blissful agony, but to no avail. It had laid its slimy hands on
			me, explaining thatâ€¦ explaining that I was.

			<br />
			<br />

			And yeah, that's my response. As I said, while it is a creepy horror story
			I just love it.
